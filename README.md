# Crime Statistics in DC 

The crime incidence in the US is one of the most discussed issues in the country. Although the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in its 2018 report found an overall decline in violent and property crimes in 2018, there has been more media releases of increasing crime incidence in the US, especially mass shootings in recent periods. Increased incidence of crime is a threat to public safety and welfare. At the national level, violent crime and homicide rates increased from 2014 to 2016, but rate remain near historical lows compared to rates in the 90â€™s. 

Washington DC saw an increase in murder rate by 35.6 percent in 2018. (Brennan Center for Justice). Between 2017 and 2018, of all the types of crimes, homicide rates in DC increased the most by about 38%, followed by auto theft which increased by 13%.
